      üîê **Welcome to the Code Security Category!**

      Build [security]() into your GitHub workflow with features like [Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning), [Code Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning) and [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to keep secrets and vulnerabilities out of your codebase, and to maintain your [software supply chain](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security).

      The Code Security category is for discussions about GitHub‚Äôs security-related products and features, such as:
       - Dependabot alerts & updates
       - Secret scanning
       - Code scanning (e.g., GitHub Advanced Security, CodeQL)
       - Supply chain security (e.g., dependency insights)
       - Security advisories & vulnerability management
       - Security policy best practices on GitHub
       - Integrations with third-party security tools
     
      Examples of questions that belong in this category:
       - Questions about how to use CodeQL, secret scanning, or security alerts
       - Discussions about interpreting scan results or fixing vulnerabilities
       - Feature requests or bug reports for GitHub security products
       - Sharing tips, workflows, or best practices for code security on GitHub

      Discussions that do NOT belong in Code Security include:
       - General programming help (language syntax, debugging, unrelated bugs)
       - Non-GitHub security questions (OS, network, or unrelated app security)
       - Questions about malware removal, antivirus, or personal device security
       - Account/password recovery issues (these go to GitHub Support)
       - Generic ‚Äúhow do I get a job in security?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat is cybersecurity?‚Äù posts. Be specific!
